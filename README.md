* [Ruby Documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)

####Rails Links
* [Rails Book](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book) Really good introduction to Rails and backend web development in general. Today we are effectively completing Chapters 1 & 2.

* [Rails Documentation](http://api.rubyonrails.org/)

####Other Gems (i.e. Packages) & Useful Tools
* [RVM](https://rvm.io/) Ruby Version Manager, installs and switches between rubies. RVM also has the concept of gemsets to isolate projects' environments completely.
* [RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/) Software used to manage what Ruby Packages/Libraries (called gems) are installed.
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) Gem dependency resolver.
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book) Version control software.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) A cloud application platform that makes it really easy to deploy applications. Deployin basic apps for testing is free.

####Nitrous.io
A cloud development environment, i.e. you program from any browser or terminal on a server located somewhere else.

We're using this for two reasons:

1. Getting Ruby and Rails setup properly on Windows is a non-trivial task and this gives an Ubuntu box with a lot of stuff we need already installed 
2. This way all the setup we do today doesn't just apply to the lab computer you happen to be on.

If you would like to setup ruby on your own machine I recommend reading through [this guide](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#sec-up_and_running), which offers various recommendations for Linux, Mac, and Windows machines, 

###Ruby/Rails Setup
-------
We're going to use a Nitrous.io Ruby box, which should come pre installed with Ruby, RVM, and RubyGems. If you want to do this on your own machine, look into [this section of the Rails book.](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#sec-up_and_running)

1. [Create a Nitrous.io account](https://www.nitrous.io/join/qC8ddqET1Ak)
2. Build a Ruby Box on the East Coast (you can adjust the settings later)
3. After it provisions the box it should pop up the IDE. In Rails programming a lot of work is done in the terminal, so some useful Nitrous shortcuts are:
  * Swap full screen terminal: Ctrl Shift F
  * Swap cursor focus from terminal to ide: Ctrl Shift C
4. RVM is a nice way to swap between different versions of Ruby. It should be installed, to check in the terminal run:

      <rvm -v>

  This should output: rvm, followed by the version number and some other stuff
5. Ruby
