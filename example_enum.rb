# Arrays

# This is an array
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Arrays can contain different types of items

[1, "hello", false] #=> [1, "hello", false]

# Arrays can be indexed
# From the front
array[0] #=> 1
array[12] #=> nil

# Like arithmetic, [var] access
# is just syntactic sugar
# for calling a method [] on an object
array.[] 0 #=> 1
array.[] 12 #=> nil

# From the end
array[-1] #=> 5

# With a start and end index
array[2, 4] #=> [3, 4, 5]

# Or with a range
array[1..3] #=> [2, 3, 4]

# Add to an array like this
array << 6 #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Hashes are Ruby's primary dictionary with keys/value pairs.
# Hashes are denoted with curly braces:
hash = {'color' => 'green', 'number' => 5}

hash.keys #=> ['color', 'number']

# Hashes can be quickly looked up by key:
hash['color'] #=> 'green'
hash['number'] #=> 5

# Asking a hash for a key that doesn't exist returns nil:
hash['nothing here'] #=> nil

# Since Ruby 1.9, there's a special syntax when using symbols as keys:

new_hash = { defcon: 3, action: true}

new_hash.keys #=> [:defcon, :action]

# Tip: Both Arrays and Hashes are Enumerable
# They share a lot of useful methods such as each, map, count, and more

for counter in 1..5
  puts "iteration #{counter}"
end
#=> iteration 1
#=> iteration 2
#=> iteration 3
#=> iteration 4
#=> iteration 5

# HOWEVER, No-one uses for loops.
# Instead you should use the "each" method and pass it a block.
# A block is a bunch of code that you can pass to a method like "each".
# It is analogous to lambdas, anonymous functions or closures in other
# programming languages.
#
# The "each" method of a range runs the block once for each element of the range.
# The block is passed a counter as a parameter.
# Calling the "each" method with a block looks like this:

(1..5).each do |counter|
  puts "iteration #{counter}"
end
#=> iteration 1
#=> iteration 2
#=> iteration 3
#=> iteration 4
#=> iteration 5

# You can also surround blocks in curly brackets:
(1..5).each {|counter| puts "iteration #{counter}"}

# The contents of data structures can also be iterated using each.
array.each do |element|
  puts "#{element} is part of the array"
end
hash.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} is #{value}"
end

counter = 1
while counter <= 5 do
  puts "iteration #{counter}"
  counter += 1
end
#=> iteration 1
#=> iteration 2
#=> iteration 3
#=> iteration 4
#=> iteration 5
